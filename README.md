# Care Every Home - Empowering Healthcare Accessibility

## Abstract

**Care Every Home** is an online platform designed to help communities access medical equipment through rental and donation services. With the belief that _"every home deserves equal access to healthcare,"_ the project enables users to rent high-quality equipment at affordable rates and also encourages individuals with unused devices to donate them to others in need.

The system fosters user feedback to continuously improve services and aims to serve groups such as the elderly, patients with chronic conditions, and families with special healthcare needs. Ultimately, this project strives to build a sustainable and inclusive healthcare network for all.
